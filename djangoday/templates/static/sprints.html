<h1>Sprints</h1>
<p>Ready. Set. Code!</p>
</header>

<h2>What</h2>
<p>The Djangocon sprints are a time where people who normally live around the
world and collaborate over irc and mailing lists, come to one place to work together
in person.  While most people will be working on the Django code base, lots
of others will be working on related projects (Pinax, South, Armstrong,  etc) or they'll be working
on tasks to support Django as a project (documentation, ticket triage, promotion).
Regardless of your experience level the sprints are a great opportunity to
collaborate, learn, and give something back to the community.</p>

<h2>When</h2>
<p>The sprint kick-off will be the last session of the main conference on Thursday afternoon.<p>
<p>The sprints themselves will happen Friday and Saturday, September 7th and 8th, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>
<p>Coming Soon!</p>

<h2>How</h2>
<p>The sprints are a fairly informal event.  There is no registration required
to attend the sprints.  As the last session of the main conference, we'll be
having a sprints kick-off.  During this session leaders for the various
projects and efforts that will be worked on during the sprints will be asked to
give a quick intro to the project and a quick overview of how best people can
contribute.  During the sprints themselves, it's mostly a matter of showing up
at the venue, introducing yourself to the people you'd like to work with, and
then getting down to work.  If you have any questions or run into any problems
feel free to talk to one of the organizers who will be around or simply ask the
person you end up sitting next to.</p>

<h2>Who</h2>
<p>The sprints are an open event where everybody is welcome, even if you
didn't attend the main conference.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>This year's sprints couldn't happen without the generosity of this year's
sprint sponsors:</p>
